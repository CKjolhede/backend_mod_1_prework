#calculation using % for Practice

puts "The module expression is used to calculate an integer as the remainder of a division"

puts "In the example, the calculation which led to the number of roosters used the % symbol"
puts "The calculation for roosters was 'Roosters {100 - 25 * 3 % 4}'"
puts "The order of operations was first: 25*3"
puts "The equation is now {100 - 75 % 4}"
puts " Next, solve 75 % 4"
puts "75 / 4 = 18 remainder of 3"
puts "The % solves this for just the remainder, or 3"
puts "Finally, 100 - 3 = 97"

puts " Roosters #{100-25 * 3 % 4}"
